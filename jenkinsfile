    def server = Artifactory.server 'TestArtifactoryName'
   
    // Step 2: Create an Artifactory Docker instance:
    def rtDocker = Artifactory.docker server: server
    // Or if the docker daemon is configured to use a TCP connection:
    // def rtDocker = Artifactory.docker server: server, host: "tcp://<docker daemon host>:<docker daemon port>"
    // If your agent is running on OSX:
    // def rtDocker= Artifactory.docker server: server, host: "tcp://127.0.0.1:1234"
   
    // Step 3: Push the image to Artifactory.
    // Make sure that <artifactoryDockerRegistry> is configured to reference <targetRepo> Artifactory repository. In case it references a different repository, your build will fail with "Could not find manifest.json in Artifactory..." following the push.

    // Step 4: Publish the build-info to Artifactory:
